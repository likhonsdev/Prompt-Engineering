- Every route must be valid and resolvable
- No dummy buttons or placeholder pages
- All actions must be backed by logic or mocked APIs
- Use real-world scenarios (auth, dashboard, CRUD, payments)
- Avoid 404s and broken flows
- Validate inputs and provide real-time feedback
- Only generate connected UI/UX with backend logic
